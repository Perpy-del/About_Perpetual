My name is Perpetual Meninwa. I am an aspiring Software Engineer/Cloud Practitioner.

I am a tech enthusiast. I started out as a Product Designer before heading into the Software and Cloud Engineering field. Right now, I am loving what I do everyday. Learning how to use code to solve everyday problems.

I hope to join one of the top organisations solving technological problem. I also would love to have a startup tech company of my own soon. My main goal is to impact young lives by passing the knowledge I have gained to others as well.

Thank you for reading.

From your favourite TechLover.
